## Containers

<details>
  <summary>Images & Containers</summary>

### Images

Images are one of the two core building blocks Docker is all about (the other one is "Containers").

- Images are blueprints/templates for containers. They are read-only and contain the application as well as the necessary application environment (operating system, runtimes, tools, etc.).
- Images do not run themselves; instead, they can be executed as containers.
- Images are either pre-built (e.g., official Images you find on DockerHub) or you build your own Images by defining a Dockerfile.
- Dockerfiles contain instructions which are executed when an image is built (`docker build .`), every instruction then creates a layer in the image. Layers are used to efficiently rebuild and share images.
- The `CMD` instruction is special: It's not executed when the image is built but when a container is created and started based on that image.

### Containers

Containers are the other key building block Docker is all about.

- Containers are running instances of Images. When you create a container (via `docker run`), a thin read-write layer is added on top of the Image.
- Multiple Containers can therefore be started based on one and the same Image. All Containers run in isolation, i.e., they don't share any application state or written data.
- You need to create and start a Container to start the application which is inside of a Container. So it's Containers which are in the end executed - both in development and production.

  <summary>Key Docker Commands</summary>
  <br>

For a full list of all commands, add `--help` after a command - e.g., `docker --help`, `docker run --help`, etc.

Also, view the official docs for a full, detailed documentation of ALL commands and features: [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/)

- `docker build .`: Build a Dockerfile and create your own Image based on the file
  - `-t NAME:TAG`: Assign a NAME and a TAG to an image
- `docker run IMAGE_NAME`: Create and start a new container based on image IMAGENAME (or use the image id)
  - `--name NAME`: Assign a NAME to the container. The name can be used for stopping and removing etc.
  - `-d`: Run the container in detached mode - i.e. output printed by the container is not visible, the command prompt/terminal does NOT wait for the container to stop
  - `-it`: Run the container in "interactive" mode - the container/application is then prepared to receive input via the command prompt/terminal. You can stop the container with CTRL + C when using the `-it` flag
  - `--rm`: Automatically remove the container when it's stopped
- `docker ps`: List all running containers
  - `-a`: List all containers - including stopped ones
- `docker images`: List all locally stored images
- `docker rm CONTAINER`: Remove a container with name CONTAINER (you can also use the container id)
- `docker rmi IMAGE`: Remove an image by name/id
- `docker container prune`: Remove all stopped containers
- `docker image prune`: Remove all dangling images (untagged images)
  - `-a`: Remove all locally stored images
- `docker push IMAGE`: Push an image to DockerHub (or another registry) - the image name/tag must include the repository name/url
- `docker pull IMAGE`: Pull (download) an image from DockerHub (or another registry) - this is done automatically if you just `docker run IMAGE` and the image wasn't pulled before

## Data & Volumes

<details>
  <summary>Images & Containers</summary>
  <br>
Images are read-only - once they're created, they can't change (you have to rebuild them to update them).

Containers, on the other hand, can read and write - they add a thin "read-write layer" on top of the image. That means that they can make changes to the files and folders in the image without actually changing the image.

But even with read-write Containers, two big problems occur in many applications using Docker:

1. Data written in a Container doesn't persist: If the Container is stopped and removed, all data written in the Container is lost.
2. The container Container can't interact with the host filesystem: If you change something in your host project folder, those changes are not reflected in the running container. You need to rebuild the image (which copies the folders) and start a new container.

Problem 1 can be solved with a Docker feature called "Volumes". Problem 2 can be solved by using "Bind Mounts".

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Volumes</summary>
  <br>
Volumes are folders (and files) managed on your host machine which are connected to folders/files inside of a container.

There are two types of Volumes:

- **Anonymous Volumes**: Created via `-v /some/path/in/container` and removed automatically when a container is removed because of `--rm` added on the `docker run` command.
- **Named Volumes**: Created via `-v some-name:/some/path/in/container` and NOT removed automatically.

With Volumes, data can be passed into a container (if the folder on the host machine is not empty) and it can be saved when written by a container (changes made by the container are reflected on your host machine).

Volumes are created and managed by Docker - as a developer, you don't necessarily know where exactly the folders are stored on your host machine. Because the data stored in there is not meant to be viewed or edited by you - use "Bind Mounts" if you need to do that!

Instead, especially Named Volumes can help you with persisting data.

Since data is not just written in the container but also on your host machine, the data survives even if a container is removed (because the Named Volume isn't removed in that case). Hence you can use Named Volumes to persist container data (e.g., log files, uploaded files, database files, etc).

Anonymous Volumes can be useful for ensuring that some Container-internal folder is not overwritten by a "Bind Mount" for example.

By default, Anonymous Volumes are removed if the Container was started with the `--rm` option and was stopped thereafter. They are not removed if a Container was started (and then removed) without that option.

Named Volumes are never removed, you need to do that manually (via `docker volume rm VOL_NAME`, see reference below).

<details>
  <summary>Bind Mounts</summary>
  <br>
Bind Mounts are very similar to Volumes - the key difference is, that you, the developer, set the path on your host machine that should be connected to some path inside of a Container.

You do that via `-v /absolute/path/on/your/host/machine:/some/path/inside/of/container`.

The path in front of the `:` (i.e., the path on your host machine, to the folder that should be shared with the container) has to be an absolute path when using `-v` on the `docker run` command.

Bind Mounts are very useful for sharing data with a Container which might change whilst the container is running - e.g., your source code that you want to share with the Container running your development environment.

Don't use Bind Mounts if you just want to persist data - Named Volumes should be used for that (exception: You want to be able to inspect the data written during development).

In general, Bind Mounts are a great tool during development - they're not meant to be used in production (since your container should run isolated from its host machine).

  <summary>Key Docker Commands</summary>
  <br>
  
- `docker run -v /path/in/container IMAGE`: Create an Anonymous Volume inside a Container.
- `docker run -v some-name:/path/in/container IMAGE`: Create a Named Volume (named some-name) inside a Container.
- `docker run -v /path/on/your/host/machine:path/in/container IMAGE`: Create a Bind Mount and connect a local path on your host machine to some path in the Container.
- `docker volume ls`: List all currently active/stored Volumes (by all Containers).
- `docker volume create VOL_NAME`: Create a new (Named) Volume named VOL_NAME. You typically don't need to do that, since Docker creates them automatically for you if they don't exist when running a container.
- `docker volume rm VOL_NAME`: Remove a Volume by its name (or ID).
- `docker volume prune`: Remove all unused Volumes (i.e., not connected to a currently running or stopped container).
